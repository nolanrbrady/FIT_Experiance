Other areas of research interests include examining how individual differences, such as non-cognitive traits and intelligence, influence learning outcomes and adult development.<br /><br />With over 10 years of experience in teaching and research, Dr. Kirkland brings a synergistic approach to understanding the human psyche. She teaches undergraduate and graduate classes in lifespan development, educational psychology, research methods, aging, and human learning. Her expertise in cognition, motivation, and adult development, as well as training in the deliberative process, heavily influences her teaching and presentation style. She particularly enjoys mentoring students in the research process and helping professionals develop emotionally and psychologically to maximize their wellbeing.<br /><br />Prior to her academic career, Dr. Kirkland was a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist through the National Strength and Conditioning Association and a continuing education instructor for the American Council on Exercise and International Sports Sciences Association. With a background in both exercise and psychological science, Dr. Kirkland is passionate about educating people regarding the mind-body connection. She enjoys teaching topics related to health and positive psychology, such as how thinking processes have a profound effect on the bodyâ€™s immune system and aging process. She is also interested in the emotional and cognitive benefits of physical activity. Dr. Kirkland is passionate about teaching others how to apply psychological science to their own lives. She believes that human development is maximized when people are challenged and face their fears. Just as physical fitness improves with exercise, Dr. Kirkland teaches that mental and emotional health improve with consistent work and effort.<br /><br />Why FIT?<br /><br />Having the opportunity to work at FIT has been a dream come true. The FIT philosophy of living with purpose, choosing the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and working to improve cognitively, emotionally, physically, and financially is a philosophy that I live daily. In particular, working at FIT challenges me to always seek improvement, which is one of my most valued principles. In my late 20s, I was diagnosed with severe deep dyslexia. What could be seen as a disadvantage, I have come to see as my greatest advantage, as this challenge has shaped how I approach life. The best part of working at FIT is experiencing the layers of fulfillment from collaborating with a Fully Integrated Team and the benefits of living a Fully Integrated experience. Most importantly, the FIT philosophy challenges me every day to make the most of my life and continue to grow and develop while making a positive impact on others<br /><br />In addition to FIT, Dr. Kirkland loves spending time with her husband and their two boys. As a family, they enjoy working out, reading, learning, and spending time in the mountains.
