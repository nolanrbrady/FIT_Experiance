The FIT process is a holistic approach that enables you to identify where you are (Current State), determine where you want to be (Desired Future State), and provide a pathway to achieving your dreams (Strategic Process). <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Current State</p> Becoming FIT begins by identifying who and where you are (your current state). By completing our comprehensive FIT Assessment, you will receive a clear inventory across four key life dimensions: Cognitive, Emotional, Physical, and Financial. As a result of this assessment, you will know how integrated, aligned, and balanced you are across these dimensions, which will enable you to effectively engage in the right areas for improvement. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Future Desired State </p> After analyzing your assessment results, FIT assists you in identifying your Future Desired State. This includes a process of identifying your goals and areas that are lacking fulfillment in your life. We will prompt you to consider whether there are aspects of your life that you want to change or improve. Identifying your Future Desired State includes recognizing the obstacles that are keeping you from achieving what you want most in life. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Strategic Process </p> Finally, FIT helps you develop your Strategic Process, bridging the gap between Current and Desired Future States. This process plan will help you identify and remove prominent barriers in your life, such as beliefs about what is possible, and guide you toward your Desired Self.  <br /><br /> We have developed four FIT plans to meet your needs at various levels of engagement. Our Evolve and Thrive plans allow you to engage in our Dream Process, where you imagine who and where you want to be in one, five, or ten years. This Dream Process will guide the direction and purpose behind engaging with FIT. While we have a library of tools to help you move toward your Future Desired State, we believe that identifying your dreams will launch you toward a state of FITness. <br /><br /> The FIT process challenges individuals to become integrated across the four key life dimensions and includes identifying and applying purposeful actions for optimal health and fulfillment. Living FIT necessitates growth and development. Improvement in one dimension unleashes further growth in other dimensions, creating a nutrient-rich environment for ongoing progress and improvement.  <br /><br /> Welcome to the FIT Experience. Our desire is to come alongside you and form a collaborative relationship to help you flourish in all aspects of your life. We invite you to begin your journey to Getting FIT by taking the FIT Assessment. We believe your greatest days are still ahead. Click below to begin your journey to FITness in 4D.
