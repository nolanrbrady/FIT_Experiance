{% block page_content %}
<p>The FIT process is a holistic approach that enables you to identify where your organization is at (Current State), determine where you desire your organization to be (Desired Future State), and provide a pathway to achieving your organizational goals (Strategic Process). <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Current State </p> Becoming FIT begins with two comprehensive FIT Assessments that provide a clear picture of your current state. The Individual FIT Assessment measures each employee’s FITness across the four key life dimensions: Cognitive, Emotional, Physical, and Financial, which is 'FIT in 4-D.' Alongside the Individual FIT Assessments, the Organizational FIT Assessment provides a clear picture of the current state of alignment across the four critical areas of business and organizational health: Engagement, Alignment, Environment, and Productivity . As a result of these assessments, you will know how integrated, aligned, and balanced your organization is, which will enable your organizational leaders to effectively engage in the right areas for improvement. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Future Desired State </p> After analyzing your assessment results, FIT assists you in identifying your organization’s Future Desired State. We do this by using the results from the Organizational FIT Assessment to help identify the areas that your organization desires to improve. For example, based on the FIT Assessment results, your organization might decide to develop an action plan for improving your work environment. This Future Desired State might include improving your organization’s environment by promoting healthy lifestyle choices such as physical activity and a toxin-free environment. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Strategic Process </p>Finally, FIT helps you develop your Strategic Process, bridging the gap between Current and Desired Future States. Essentially, this is building your FIT organization, or as we call it, your FIT house. This best ensures you effectively remove barriers and helps you best achieve your desired results. <br /><br />Building a FIT house involves aligning your organization around the right things, at the right time, for the right reasons. That is, making sure your organization is aligned around one Purpose and operating with non-negotiable shared Principles. FIT helps organizations deliver the best Promise to internal and external customers. We have extensive experience in developing realistic and sustainable programs to promote the wellness of your organization. This includes maximizing your productivity and profitability through sustainable measures and efforts. <br /><br />An organization is only as FIT as the people who make up the organization. The FIT process challenges individuals to become integrated across the key life dimensions and includes identifying and applying purposeful actions for optimal health and fulfillment. Living FIT necessitates growth and development across these dimensions. Improvement in one dimension unleashes further growth in other dimensions, creating a nutrient-rich environment for ongoing progress and improvement. <br /><br />Welcome to the FIT Experience. We invite you and your organization to begin your journey to Getting FIT by taking the Organizational FIT Assessment. We believe your greatest days are still ahead.
