Over the past 30 years, professional coaching has been an emerging, promising, and evolving field. It has a great presence in both the individual and executive venues and continues to make a positive impact. <br /><br />A coach’s goal, whether individually or organizationally, and regardless of the area of expertise or specialization, is to collaborate with the client to help them develop their fullest potential. Coaches work alongside their client, eliciting the desired change of the client that unleashes their greatest potential. <br /><br />The FIT process is a holistic approach that enables you to identify your clients’ strengths and areas of opportunity (Current State), determine their goals (Desired Future State), and provide a pathway to achieving their dreams (Strategic Process). <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Current State </p>The FIT process starts with our proprietary FIT Assessment. This allows you to understand your client’s current state in four key life dimensions: Cognitive, Emotional, Physical, and Financial. After completing the assessment, you and your client will become aware of how FIT he or she is across the four dimensions. We call this “FIT in 4D”. As a result of the FIT assessment, you will know how integrated, aligned, and balanced your client is, which will provide resources for you to effectively keep your client engaged and motivated in pursuing his or her goals. As a coach, you can more effectively target the areas that need the most work. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Future Desired State </p>After analyzing your client’s assessment results, you can assist your client in identifying his or her Future Desired State. This collaborative process capitalizes on your current relationship with your client. That is, your deep understanding of your client’s needs along with your client’s FIT Assessment results can help your client discover his or her Future Desired State. With this clear vision, you can help your client bridge this gap with a detailed Strategic Process that assists the client in moving toward his or her goals. <br /><br /> <p class='pageTitle paragraphTitle'>Strategic Process </p>FIT provides you with the framework that assists you in guiding your clients through an integrated and intentional experience. In the spirit of coaching, our process allows the client to create their own masterpiece regarding where they want to be in life. We are a collaborative partner providing you with new tools and resources, which provide you a unique point of reference to keep your clients committed to working with you. <br /><br />The FIT process challenges individuals to become integrated across the key life dimensions and includes identifying and applying purposeful actions for optimal health and fulfillment. Living FIT necessitates growth and development across these dimensions. Improvement in one dimension unleashes further growth in other dimensions, creating a nutrient-rich environment for ongoing progress and improvement. <br /><br />Welcome to the FIT Experience. We invite you to use our science-based, validated tools that will enable you to better coach your clients to optimize their performance and return on investment. <br />Click below to begin your journey to FITness in 4D.<br /><br />
