Jim Leighton is Chairman and Founder of Get FIT Enterprises.  He is also a published author, entrepreneur, educator, and public speaker. He has held numerous senior executive and Board positions in the Food and Beverage Industry.<br /><br />Mr. Leighton holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration and industrial relations from the University of Iowa and a Master of Business Administration degree from Keller Graduate School of Management, where he taught graduate students Leadership and Organizational Behavior. He is the creator and author of Getting FIT - Unleashing the Power of Fully Integrated Teams.<br /><br />Mr. Leighton’s purpose in life is to assist people in living more intentional, fulfilled, and balanced lives by engaging them and their organizations in the FIT process.  His passion is to bring people together into Fully Integrated Teams, allowing for a much greater outcome than any one individual could create alone. Mr. Leighton believes that leaders should empower others to become the best version of themselves, and he is living this out through the FIT process.<br /><br />Why FIT?<br /><br />I have had jobs ranging from ditch digger to professor, president to CEO and board member. I have founded, run, sold, and even allowed for the bankruptcy of my own startup. I have met with some successes as well as many failures. Along that lengthy path, two primary questions surfaced unanswered:  First, why do some people, organizations, married couples, and societies find fulfillment while others do not? And second, why are some of these individuals and groups able to sustain a higher level of success and performance for a longer period of time than others? Driven by these questions and my thirty-five years of leadership experience within the consumer packaged goods industry, I developed the FIT philosophy. I have had the privilege of seeing well over 100,000 people, exposed to the FIT process, thrive.<br /><br />People and organizations have different ways of measuring success, but a common definition lies in finding a sense of meaning and purpose at work and more importantly, in life. At the intersection of organizational success and individual success is the concept of FIT, or Fully Integrated Teams. FIT is a wide-ranging concept, yet is built around a tight cluster of principles and core values with practical application on a number of fronts. At certain points, and especially as it concerns your own progress and direction in life and career, you can expand the meaning of FIT to “Fully Integrated Trajectory” or “Fully Integrated Today and Tomorrow”. The key is integration and balance across four dimensions of life: Cognitive, Emotional, Physical and Financial. Only when we are FIT in, and across, these dimensions are we truly FIT for a purpose-driven life.<br /><br />I strongly believe, and a great deal of research supports my belief, that the old operating philosophy and system that got us to where we are will not get us to where we desire to go.  And this is true for both the individual and the organization.  Therefore, I challenged the status quo by creating a new operating philosophy.  I have brought life to that philosophy by creating a Fully Integrated Team of professionals who share a common purpose and principles.  Together, we have created something much greater than any individual could create alone.  Welcome to the FIT experience.  I hope you enjoy your journey.
