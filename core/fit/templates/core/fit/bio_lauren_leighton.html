{% block story %}
Lauren Leighton is the Creative Director at Get FIT Enterprises.  She completed her undergraduate degree in social studies and secondary education in 2011. Subsequently, she became a College Board AP Psychology certified teacher and introduced students to the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. Ms. Leighton exposed students to psychological facts, principles, and theories associated with each of the major subfields within psychology while encouraging critical thinking, creativity and experiential education through class experiments, projects, and experiential learning.<br /><br />In addition to teaching psychology, Ms. Leighton was a head coach for a three-season sport, the wellness coordinator for her staff, and the Acts of Kindness advisor.  In these roles, she provided students with the tools to be happy and emotionally-resilient, created an anti-bullying campaign alongside students in order to create a more unified school environment, and promoted kindness by raising student awareness of social and environmental issues.<br /><br />After three years of teaching, she moved to Colorado for three reasons: to be close to family and friends, to pursue her passion in photography, and to assist in transforming her father's book Getting FIT: Unleashing the Power of Fully Integrated Teams into a thriving and purposeful consulting company. She currently serves FIT by determining project content through creating, reviewing, and approving materials developed by herself and fellow staff. Ms. Leighton is also founder of 2themtn, a FIT-inspired blog where she inspires others with her journey of personal growth and self-discovery.<br /><br />Why FIT?<br /><br />I started my FIT journey as a child, growing up listening to my father talk about the principles of FIT. I was given the opportunity to learn how to live a purposeful life at a young age; one where I define my principles and surround myself with positive people in a nutrient-rich environment. I joined the FIT team because I truly believe in this process; when I am fully engaged in FIT, I am living a more intentional, satisfying, and productive life. I am fortunate to work with the most amazing group of people who I respect immensely. Our FIT team supports one another, and we all strive to make a positive impact on this world. My goal is to provide others the opportunity to make positive changes in their lives through the FIT process so that their dreams can become a reality.
