Dr. Ilene Rusk is the Emotional Coach for Get FIT Enterprises. She completed her PhD in Psychology in 1989 at the University of Birmingham in England and subsequently completed three postdoctoral fellowship positions in the departments of neurology, psychiatry, and psychology in the UK and Canada. She is trained as a clinical neuroscientist and neuropsychologist. Dr. Rusk has authored numerous peer-reviewed articles in psychopharmacology, brain-behavior relationships, and Alzheimer’s disease.  In addition to her hard sciences background, she has extensively explored the areas of spirituality, mysticism, and mindfulness for over 30 years.  She sees deep value and beauty in blending empiricism with understanding our purpose here on earth.<br /><br />She is a sought-after lecturer and gives frequent workshops on healthy aging, healthy brain functioning, and the hero’s journey of death and dying. Dr. Rusk weaves together the worlds of positive neuroscience and spirituality and works with people who are seeking to create meaning in their lives and optimize their emotional health. Her passion is to connect people with their highest selves and with each other to optimize wellbeing. She believes that leadership starts from within and is most effective and successful when it is honest, authentic, and respectful of others.<br /><br />She currently serves as Co-Director of the Brain and Behavior Clinic in Boulder, Colorado, has an active brain injury and trauma rehabilitation practice, and supervises and trains other clinicians. She is Director of Health Education for The Grillo Health Information Resource Center, a not-for-profit medical research and information service in Colorado where her most exciting initiative is implementing the UCLA Protocol for Brain Health. Dr. Rusk focuses much of her time blending personalized healthcare with emotional wellness in a scientist-practitioner model.<br /><br />Why FIT?<br /><br />I trained as a neuropsychologist so that I could help people improve their brain health and mental health through research, teaching, and clinical work. My goal is to offer these tools to numerous people, and FIT is an exciting, holistic way to do that. At FIT we believe that our Cognitive, Emotional, Physical, and Financial health are directly tied to one another. Our happiness, our connection with others, and our success and fulfillment are dependent upon these areas of health. I’m excited to be part of the FIT team because we all share the same earnest goal: to expand the definition of FITness and to offer a way to live a more Balanced life with awareness, positivity, kindness, and purpose. Our entire FIT team is passionate about supporting people’s whole health with our integrative full-life approach to wellbeing.
