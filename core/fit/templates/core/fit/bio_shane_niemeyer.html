Shane Niemeyer is the Physical Coach for Get FIT Enterprises.<br /><br />Why FIT?<br /><br />There was a time in my life where I was horribly “un-FIT” in every phase of my life.  It was a very dark time for me. I had no personal belongings to speak of, and at times I was homeless. I had become physically, intellectually, emotionally and financially broken.  I was 55 pounds overweight.  The most observable symptoms of my discontent and lack of purpose were heavy drinking and drug use which found me in and out of a variety of institutions throughout the course of my adolescence and well into adulthood.<br /><br />I reached an inflection point the last time I was incarcerated.  With no sense of meaning or direction, I had developed a belief that I could not regain control over a life that had spun wildly out of control.  In a diluted state, I attempted to exhibit one last act of self-determination and control by committing suicide.<br /><br />Mine is an extreme example of what can happen to us when we lose our sense of direction, meaning, and purpose.  In prison, after I had failed to commit suicide, I committed myself to a rigorous process of personal growth in every aspect of my life.  I began to meditate (or pray), I read a book each day (on average) so that I could expand my mental frame of reference and thereby the field of possibilities open to me.  I began to journal my thoughts and my aspirations daily, keeping record of who I wanted to become and what I wanted to do with myself.  Eventually, my life plan began to take shape, and over time, my life began to unfold the way I had envisioned it.<br /><br />Since that time, I have become a fitness and wellness expert, an author, and a speaker.   I travel the globe racing long course triathlon at an elite level.  I strive to maintain alignment through all facets of my life, a process which began in prison all those years ago.  Since those days I have been obsessed with understanding the human condition and helping others realize their potential.<br /><br />As a strength and conditioning coach, I have worked closely with hundreds upon hundreds of highly successful individuals from across the globe, many of whom became mentors to me.  I paid closest attention to those who were living life the way I wanted to live mine.  Jim Leighton is at the very top of that list.  The first time I met Jim, he explained his FIT operating philosophy to me and immediately it occurred to me that his life philosophy and mine were nearly identical.  The only difference was that Jim had become his philosophy.  Since that time, I have used Jim and the FIT philosophy as my model of thought and conduct.<br /><br />As humans, we are thinking, feeling, spiritual beings who are embodied in the biological organism of our bodies.  We are tied to the state of our body.  When our body is inactive or in a state of disrepair it necessarily follows that we operate at a much lower level in every other dimension of life.  Everything about our bodies is designed to move.  Exercise promotes much higher levels of wellbeing and creativity, and enhances our intelligence through the production of a variety of physiological and neurochemical agents.<br /><br />What we are capable of is extraordinary, but what we actually do often falls short of our potential.  The FIT philosophy is the most comprehensive and well balanced approach I have ever seen and provides us with tools to completely transform our life.
