First, I believe in the principle and philosophy of a FIT life, to truly challenge myself every day in the four dimensions, maximize my FITness in these dimensions, and find balance in my life. I have found that even when you face the most difficult of challenges, adhering to these principles can make any challenge seem learnable, manageable, and solvable. Second, the people here at FIT are passionate about the FIT life, believe in the science and principles that we promote, and truly care about helping people. Without them and this joint passion, FIT would not be possible.
